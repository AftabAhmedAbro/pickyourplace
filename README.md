# PickYourPlace

PickYourPlace is an application that allows users to visualize and navigate the world surrounding properties and make spatially-aware decisions. It enables users to understand property value trends in different geographic areas, evaluate a number of safety factors in a localized view, and compare accessibility to nearby amenities using different travel modes (walking, biking, public transit, and driving).

The frontend application is an SPA (single page app), built using Vue.js, Vuetify, and Mapbox GL JS. PostgreSQL/PostGIS, pg_tileserv, and OpenTripPlanner run the database and backend services for this project.
